# Multiple Linear Regression Model for Beta Carotene Plasma

Using multiple linear regression, the association of beta carotene with twelve predictor variables were studied in 315 patients who had an elective surgical procedure during a three-year period to biopsy, or removal of a lesion that was found to be noncancerous. Beta carotene plasma was negatively related to body mass index (BMI) and positively related to grams of fiber consumed per day. Furthermore, out of the 13 males who never smoked only six take supplemental vitamins compared to the 104 females who take vitamins out of 143 females who have never smoked.
